## CADDY V2!

This plugin has been updated to Caddy V2.  

**Master branch** and **docker CI images** are now dedicated to V2.

[Go to Caddy V1 readme](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy/blob/v0/README.md)

## Introduction
This plugin enables caddy to be used as a reverse proxy for Docker.

## How does it work?
It scans Docker metadata looking for labels indicating that the service or container should be exposed on caddy.

Then it generates an in memory Caddyfile with website entries and proxies directives pointing to each Docker service DNS name or container IP.

Every time a docker object changes, it updates the Caddyfile and triggers a caddy zero-downtime reload.

## Labels to Caddyfile conversion
Any label prefixed with caddy, will be converted to caddyfile configuration following those rules:

Keys becomes directive name and value becomes arguments:
```
caddy.directive=arg1 arg2
↓
{
	directive arg1 arg2
}
```

Dots represents nesting and grouping is done automatically:
```
caddy.directive=argA  
caddy.directive.subdirA=valueA  
caddy.directive.subdirB=valueB1 valueB2
↓
{
	directive argA {  
		subdirA valueA  
		subdirB valueB1 valueB2  
	}
}
```

Labels for parent directives are optional:
```
caddy.directive.subdirA=valueA
↓
{
	directive {
		subdirA valueA
	}
}
```

Labels with empty values generates directives without arguments:
```
caddy.directive=
↓
{
	directive
}
```

Directives are ordered alphabetically by default:
```
caddy.bbb=value
caddy.aaa=value
↓
{
	aaa value 
	bbb value
}
```

Suffix _&lt;number&gt; isolates directives that otherwise would be grouped:
```
caddy.group_0.a=value
caddy.group_1.b=value
↓
{
	group {
		a value
	}
	group {
		b value
	}
}
```

Prefix &lt;number&gt;_ isolates directives but also defines a custom ordering for directives, and directives without order prefix will go last:
```
caddy.1_bbb=value
caddy.2_aaa=value
caddy.3_aaa=value
↓
{
	bbb value
	aaa value
	aaa value
}
```

Caddy label args creates a server block:
```
caddy=example.com
caddy.respond=200 /
↓
example.com {
	respond 200 /
}
```

Or a snippet:
```
caddy=(snippet)
caddy.respond=200 /
↓
(snippet) {
	respond 200 /
}
```

It's also possible to isolate caddy configurations using suffix _&lt;number&gt;:
```
caddy_0 = (snippet)
caddy_0.tls = internal
caddy_1 = site-a.com
caddy_1.import = snippet
caddy_2 = site-b.com
caddy_2.import = snippet
↓
(snippet) {
	tls internal
}
site_a {
	import snippet
}
site_b {
	import snippet
}
```

Named matchers can be created using @ inside labels:
```
caddy = localhost
caddy.@match.path = /sourcepath /sourcepath/*
caddy.reverse_proxy = @match localhost:6001
↓
localhost {
	@match {
		path /sourcepath /sourcepath/*
	}
	reverse_proxy @match localhost:6001
}
```

Global options can be defined by not setting any value for caddy. It can be set in any container/service, including caddy-docker-proxy itself. [Here is an example](examples/standalone.yaml#L19)
```
caddy.email = you@example.com
↓
{
	email you@example.com
}
```

[GoLang templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) can be used inside label values to increase flexibility. From templates you have access to current docker resource information. But keep in mind that the structure that describes a docker container is different from a service.

While you can access a service name like this:
```
caddy.respond = /info "{{.Spec.Name}}"
↓
respond /info "myservice"
```

The equivalent to access a container name would be:
```
caddy.respond = /info "{{index .Names 0}}"
↓
respond /info "mycontainer"
```

Sometimes it's not possile to have labels with empty values, like when using some UI to manage docker. If that's the case, you can also use our support for go lang templates to generate empty labels.
```
caddy.directive={{""}}
↓
directive
```

## Template functions

The following functions are available for use inside templates:

### upstreams

Returns all addresses for the current docker resource separated by whitespace.

For services, that would be the service DNS name when **proxy-service-tasks** is **false**, or all running tasks IPs when **proxy-service-tasks** is **true**.

For containers, that would be the container IPs.

Resource networks are validated and only addresses in caddy ingress networks are returned. You can override caddy ingress networks using CLI option `ingress-networks` or environment variable `CADDY_INGRESS_NETWORKS`

Usage: `upstreams [http|https] [port]`  

Examples:
```
caddy.reverse_proxy = {{upstreams}}
↓
reverse_proxy 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2
```
```
caddy.reverse_proxy = {{upstreams https}}
↓
reverse_proxy https://192.168.0.1 https://192.168.0.2
```
```
caddy.reverse_proxy = {{upstreams 8080}}
↓
reverse_proxy 192.168.0.1:8080 192.168.0.2:8080
```
```
caddy.reverse_proxy = {{upstreams http 8080}}
↓
reverse_proxy http://192.168.0.1:8080 http://192.168.0.2:8080
```

## Reverse proxy examples
Proxying domain root to container root
```
caddy = example.com
caddy.reverse_proxy = {{upstreams}}
```

Proxying domain root to container path
```
caddy = example.com
caddy.rewrite = * /target{path}
caddy.reverse_proxy = {{upstreams}}
```

Proxying domain path to container root
```
caddy = example.com
caddy.route = /source/*
caddy.route.0_uri = strip_prefix /source
caddy.route.1_reverse_proxy = {{upstreams}}
```

Proxying domain path to different container path
```
caddy = example.com
caddy.route = /source/*
caddy.route.0_uri = strip_prefix /source
caddy.route.1_rewrite = * /target{path}
caddy.route.2_reverse_proxy = {{upstreams}}
```

Proxying domain path to subpath
```
caddy = example.com
caddy.route = /source/*
caddy.route.0_uri = strip_prefix /source
caddy.route.1_rewrite = * /source/target{path}
caddy.route.2_reverse_proxy = {{upstreams}}
```

Proxying multiple domains to container
```
caddy = example.com example.org
caddy.reverse_proxy = {{upstreams}}
```

## Docker configs
You can also add raw text to your caddyfile using docker configs. Just add caddy label prefix to your configs and the whole config content will be inserted at the beginning of the generated caddyfile, outside any server blocks.

[Here is an example](examples/standalone.yaml#L4)

## Proxying services vs containers
Caddy docker proxy is able to proxy to swarm servcies or raw containers. Both features are always enabled, and what will differentiate the proxy target is where you define your labels.

### Services
To proxy swarm services, labels should be defined at service level. On a docker-compose file, that means labels should be inside deploy, like:
```
service:
	...
	deploy:
		caddy=service.example.com
		caddy.reverse_proxy={{upstreams}}
```

Caddy will use service DNS name as target or all service tasks IPs, depending on configuration **proxy-service-tasks**.

### Containers
To proxy containers, labels should be defined at container level. On a docker-compose file, that means labels should be outside deploy, like:
```
service:
	...
	caddy=service.example.com
	caddy.reverse_proxy={{upstreams}}
```

## Execution modes

Each caddy docker proxy instance can be executed in one of the following modes.

### Server

Acts as a proxy to your docker resources. The server starts without any configuration, and will not serve anything until it is configured by a "controller".

In order to make a server discoverable and configurable by controllers, you need to mark it with label `caddy_controlled_server` and define the controller network via CLI option `controller-network` or environment variable `CADDY_CONTROLLER_NETWORK`.

Server instances doesn't need access to docker host socket and you can run it in manager or worker nodes.

[Configuration example](examples/distributed.yaml#L5)

### Controller

Controller monitors your docker cluster, generates Caddy configuration and pushes to all servers it finds in your docker cluster.

When Controller instances are connected to more than one network, it is also necessary to define the controller network via CLI option `controller-network` or environment variable `CADDY_CONTROLLER_NETWORK`.

Controller instances requires access to docker host socket.

A single controller instance can configure all server instances in your cluster.

[Configuration example](examples/distributed.yaml#L21)

### Standalone (default)

This mode executes a controller and a server in the same instance and doesn't require additional configuration.

[Configuration example](examples/standalone.yaml#L11)

## Caddy CLI

This plugin extends caddy cli with command `caddy docker-proxy` and flags.

Run `caddy help docker-proxy` to see all available flags.

```
Usage of docker-proxy:
  -caddyfile-path string
        Path to a base Caddyfile that will be extended with docker sites
  -controller-network string
        Network allowed to configure caddy server in CIDR notation. Ex: 10.200.200.0/24
  -ingress-networks string
        Comma separated name of ingress networks connecting caddy servers to containers.
        When not defined, networks attached to controller container are considered ingress networks
  -label-prefix string
        Prefix for Docker labels (default "caddy")
  -mode
        Which mode this instance should run: standalone | controller | server
  -polling-interval duration
        Interval caddy should manually check docker for a new caddyfile (default 30s)
  -process-caddyfile
        Process Caddyfile before loading it, removing invalid servers (default true)
  -proxy-service-tasks
        Proxy to service tasks instead of service load balancer (default true)
```

Those flags can also be set via environment variables:

```
CADDY_DOCKER_CADDYFILE_PATH=<string>
CADDY_CONTROLLER_NETWORK=<string>
CADDY_INGRESS_NETWORKS=<string>
CADDY_DOCKER_LABEL_PREFIX=<string>
CADDY_DOCKER_MODE=<string>
CADDY_DOCKER_POLLING_INTERVAL=<duration>
CADDY_DOCKER_PROCESS_CADDYFILE=<bool>
CADDY_DOCKER_PROXY_SERVICE_TASKS=<bool>
CADDY_DOCKER_VALIDATE_NETWORK=<bool>
```

Check **examples** folder to see how to set them on a docker compose file.

## Docker images
Docker images are available at Docker hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy/

### Choosing the version numbers
The safest approach is to use a full version numbers like 0.1.3.
That way you lock to a specific build version that works well for you.

But you can also use partial version numbers like 0.1. That means you will receive the most recent 0.1.x image. You will automatically receive updates without breaking changes.

### Chosing between default or alpine images
Our default images are very small and safe because they only contain caddy executable.
But they're also quite hard to throubleshoot because they don't have shell or any other Linux utilities like curl or dig.

The alpine images variant are based on Linux Alpine image, a very small Linux distribution with shell and basic utilities tools. Use `-alpine` images if you want to trade security and small size for better throubleshooting experience.

### CI images
Images with `ci` on it's tag name means they was automatically generated by automated builds.
CI images reflect the current state of master branch and they might be very broken sometimes.
You should use CI images if you want to help testing latest features before they're officialy released.

### ARM architecture images
Currently we provide linux x86_64 images by default.

You can also find images for other architectures like `arm32v6` images that can be used on Raspberry Pi.

### Windows images
We recently introduced experimental windows containers images with suffix `nanoserver-1803`.

Be aware that this needs to be tested further.

This is an example of how to mount the windows docker pipe using CLI:
```
docker run --rm -it -v //./pipe/docker_engine://./pipe/docker_engine lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy:ci-nanoserver-1803
```

## Connecting to Docker Host
The default connection to docker host varies per platform:
* At Unix: `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`
* At Windows: `npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine`

You can modify docker connection using the following environment variables:

* **DOCKER_HOST**: to set the url to the docker server.
* **DOCKER_API_VERSION**: to set the version of the API to reach, leave empty for latest.
* **DOCKER_CERT_PATH**: to load the tls certificates from.
* **DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY**: to enable or disable TLS verification, off by default.

## Volumes
On a production docker swarm cluster, it's **very important** to store Caddy folder on a persistent storage. Otherwise Caddy will re-issue certificates every time it is restarted, exceeding let's encrypt quota.

To do that, map a persistent docker volume to `/data` folder.

For resilient production deployments, use multiple caddy replicas and map `/data` folder to a volume that supports multiple mounts, like Network File Sharing docker volumes plugins.

Multiple Caddy instances automatically orchestrates certificate issuing between themselves when sharing `/data` folder.

[Here is an example](examples/efs-volume.yaml) of compose file with replicas and persistent volume using  Rexray EFS Plugin for AWS.

## Trying it

### With compose file

Clone this repository.

Deploy the compose file to swarm cluster:
```
docker stack deploy -c examples/standalone.yaml caddy-docker-demo
```

Wait a bit for services startup...

Now you can access each services/container using different urls
```
curl -k --resolve whoami0.example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://whoami0.example.com
curl -k --resolve whoami1.example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://whoami1.example.com
curl -k --resolve whoami2.example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://whoami2.example.com
curl -k --resolve whoami3.example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://whoami3.example.com
curl -k --resolve config.example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://config.example.com
curl -k --resolve echo0.example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://echo0.example.com/sourcepath/something
```

After testing, delete the demo stack:
```
docker stack rm caddy-docker-demo
```

### With run commands

```
docker run --name caddy -d -p 443:443 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy:ci-alpine

docker run --name whoami0 -d -l caddy=whoami0.example.com -l "caddy.reverse_proxy={{upstreams 8000}}" -l caddy.tls=internal jwilder/whoami

docker run --name whoami1 -d -l caddy=whoami1.example.com -l "caddy.reverse_proxy={{upstreams 8000}}" -l caddy.tls=internal jwilder/whoami

curl -k --resolve whoami0.example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://whoami0.example.com
curl -k --resolve whoami1.example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://whoami1.example.com

docker rm -f caddy whoami0 whoami1
```
